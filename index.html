        <h1>Homework One by Yuanyuan Ruan</h1>
        
        <h2>Tableau Prototype</h2>
        <img src="multi_catagory.png" height="600" width="500">
        <p>Description: This bar chart counts the number of each type of incidents in Tenderloin. From the chart, we can easily tell that the incident larceny/theft is the most common crime at this district, which the incident number is 170. </p>
        <p>Learning Outcome: The reason I use bar chart is that the incident catagory in Tederloin is 27, which is too many info for pie chart or line chart, and bar chart is best fit for compare and show the incident numbers for each catagory at a specific district. </p>
        <img src="multi_district.png" height="500" width="600">
        <p>Description: This bar chart counts the number of suicide in different districts, and get a result that the Northern has the most people to suicide.</p>
        <p>Learning Outcome: The reason is similar to the bar chart above, I just switch my focus on a specific incident, suicide. I find out that there are five districts that suicide occurs and the Northern shows the most number of incidents. </p>
        <img src="multi_line.png" height="600" width="500">
        <p>Description: This line chart counts the number of four catagory vary time.</p>
        <p>Learning Outcome: I choose to use line chart to show the trend of each catagory. I choose larceny/theft to compare with other three catagory. As we can tell that these four line trend are similar before time= 4am , and larceny/theft have a significant increase and a big drop at around time=19pm. </p>
